# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## My Goal

In this app I've learned some more Dart programming concepts as well as how to use open source Flutter packages. 

## What I've created

I've made a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
